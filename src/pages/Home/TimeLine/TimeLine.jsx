            <p>
              Before any project work begins. we need to create a product
              backlog. It replaces the traditional requirements specification
              artifacts. This is essentially a list of the goals that need to be
              achieved in order to create a finished product. These are the list
              of epics or stories listed in order of priority. We conduct
              backlog refinement sessions to ensure that it contains the
              appropriate items, are prioritized and that the items at the top
              are ready for delivery.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Sprint is an iteration, a time-boxed effort in which we produce a
              specified working software. During a sprint planning session, we
              set a sprint goal and create a sprint backlog from the product
              backlog. Sprint planning is a a collaborative effort involving the
              Development Team, Scrum Master and the Product Owner to clarify
              the details of the user stories and their respective acceptance
              criteria.

            </h2>
            <p>
              In the second part of the Sprint planning session, we break down
              the stories in sprint backlog into tasks which can be tracked
              easily. The tasks are then checked for dependencies and the
              required time is estimated. We may also update the sprint backlog
              as more details are visible at this point. After that, we update
              the scrum board with stories in story to do section and tasks in
              the task to do section. The scrum board is used and updated during
              the whole sprint.

              This is the time where the actual coding, testing, UI designing,
              technical writeups etc. are performed. We stand for 5-minutes
              daily scrum meetings to sync everyone with the latest development,
              improve communications, eliminate other meetings and identify
              impediments to development for removal, highlight, and promote
              quick decision-making. We track our development work in the sprint
              board, remaining hours are plotted in a burndown chart.

              This is not a separate phase at the end of coding as done
              typically, rather it is done inside the sprint. When the stories
              are ready for review, they are tested according to the acceptance
              criteria of the stories. The bug is fixed and retested if
              required. We perform the Integration and regression testing when
              all stories in the sprint are done. It ensures that the
              deliverable or increment is in working condition and ready.

              At the end of the sprint, we hold a sprint review session where

              also plan for any changes that need to be done according to
              feedback. We hold a sprint retrospective session after the sprint
              is concluded to see what went well, what went wrong and what can
              be improved in the process. It enables us to continuously evolve
